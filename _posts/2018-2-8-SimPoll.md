title: What is SimPoll.org?
---
# Beginnings . . .
I got so fed up with polls trying to tell me what my demographic group was supposed to think that I said, “Hell, I’d pay to have my actual opinion recorded!”  And that’s how SimPoll.org was born.

It doesn’t matter who you are, where in the US you live, or how you formed your opinions.  What I think matters most is for all of us to accurately record what we are thinking right now.  

# The SimPoll.org Difference . . .
Traditional polling organizations, like Gallup, Rasmussen, Zogby, and many others, all function in the same way.  They collect answers to their polling questions from “anonymous participants”.  Then they sell the polling data to news organizations.  I think time has proven this to be a faulty method that is easily manipulated.  

SimPoll.org will be the exact opposite of these polling organizations.  Instead of using anonymous participants, SimPoll.org will permit users to register.  There will be a small fee for registration, and an even smaller yearly fee to continue.  But the registration process will establish your user account and permit you to be counted in the official results displayed freely to the word.

All user profiles and answers will be hidden.  A 32 bit user ID number will be generated and hidden from everyone, including the user.  This will directly link your answers to the polling results while maintaining your privacy.  In the even a poll is in dispute, SimPoll.org can easily provide audit information to confirm the results.

# Boil it down . . .
The biggest difference between SimPoll.org and the other polling organizations will be found in the questions themselves.  Each SimPoll will be comprised of just ONE question.  Questions will never lead the user to a desired answer.  There will be no questions on how or why you think what you think.  And the questions must never reveal the opinion of the person who drafted the question.

To illustrate - one of the most slanted questions I ever saw asked, “Do you want to see young women die in back alley abortions because the right to choose was taken away?”  I don’t care which side of that issue you find yourself, you have to agree that this is a heavily slanted question.  Instead, SimPoll.org will ask . . .

	Are you for or against abortion?

I think you will agree that this is the only fair way to discover what we are all thinking.

# The power of numbers . . . 
Statisticians love to claim that a sample size of 1,000 participants is “significant”.  Meaning that the opinion of just 1,000 people can represent the entire population of the US.  

The goal of SimPoll.org is to have hundreds of thousands, or even millions of registered users.  Each user will be categorized demographically by the answers in their profile.  Having 10 or 100 times the standard “sample size” on record, SimPoll.org will be able to provide more accuracy in the overall opinions of US citizens. 

# Preventing SPAM Accounts . . .
Paid user registration will prevent a lot of fake accounts from being created.  But beyond that, SimPoll.org will have rules governing account usage.  Answers to profile questions must be LOCKED before a user’s answers maybe counted in the official poll results.  This is to prevent a person from switching a demographic category just to participate in a restricted poll.  

For example, some polls will only target a specific demographic group.  If a user was Female, changing their gender to Male just to participate in a poll for males only would not be permitted.

Profile answers can change, but it will require administrator review and approval first.

Paid user registration, locked profiles, and a lengthy profile change process will assure that polling answers are accurate.

# What about free accounts?
Yes, SimPoll.org will have free accounts.  A free account will permit users to answer polling questions and receive SimPoll.org notifications of new polls.  But answers provided by free account users will not be counted in with the registered user results.  In fact, the free account answers will not be counted at all.  But a free user will get to see where their answers match up with the answers provided by the registered users.

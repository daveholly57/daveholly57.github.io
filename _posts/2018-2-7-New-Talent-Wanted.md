Django/Python coders needed.  Experience in PostgreSQL is nice.

Expertise also needed for security and adding control to the site to manage privacy and accountability.

-------------

SimPoll is Written in Python with Django.  The database is PostgreSQL.  

SimPoll allows you to record you opinions and positions on current Social and Political issues.  SimPoll boils issue questions down to just one question.  Questions are not permitted to have a "slant", or a "bias" of any kind.  

For example, instead of leading questions to try and determine why or how a person came to their concluson on abortion, SimPoll will just ask . . .

Are you for or against abortion?
